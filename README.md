# QDN

A just-for-fun data exchange format similar to JSON. 

The primary goal of this project was teaching myself how to use reflection in go.

The QDN-format was originally developed as a way to store settings for [QDU](https://github.com/4kills/QDU) 
but eventually dropped and replaced with json, which the format was heavily inspired by to begin with. 

QDN does not support collections but otherwise go structs with primitves of all kinds.
